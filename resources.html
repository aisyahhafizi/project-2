        <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
        <p>
          Biases can be either implicit or explicit and both biases shape how we treat others. According to DePaul University, biases can influence 
          how people act toward certain groups. Explicit bias is when people are aware of their stereotypes and act on them. Implicit bias is more 
          hidden and usually happens without us realizing it. In this section, we will focus on implicit bias, why this is matters and how it shows up. 
          Oxford Dictionary explains that implicit bias as unconscious favoritism or prejudice based on traits like race, gender or social group.

        <h2>How Implicit Bias Happens & Why Is It Matters?</h2>
        <p>
          According to Cherry from Very Well Mind, implicit bias develops because our brains automatically look for patterns and connections. 
          When we interact with others, we use this habit called social cognition to quickly understand and respond to social situations. North
          Carolina State University also highlights that implicit biases benefit some groups while placing others at a disadvantage because it can
          quietly affect decisions. For example, college admissions, hiring process and social interactions that can reduce diversity and equal 
          opportunity.

        <h2>Testing for Implicit Bias (IBT/IAT)</h2>
        <p>
          The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) or also known as The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a tool created by psychologists at Harvard to help 
          highlight and uncover biases. This test is not definite but it can spark reflection and conversations. This test measures how strongly 
          people connect certain groups (eg: fat vs thin) with positive or negative ideas. In the test, you quickly sort words or images into categories
          by pressing keys. The first section will asks you to sort concepts, then good vs bad words and later the mix of both. Then, the categories 
          switch sides and reverse and you will end up sorting in opposite pairings. Your score comes from how much faster you respond to one pairing
          compared to the opposite, showing which associations feel easier and more automatic.

        <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
        <p>
          Intersectionality, a term introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, explains how different aspects of a person's identity such as race, gender 
          or class combine to shape their experiences. The Oxford Dictionary defines it as "the interconnected nature or social categorizations such as race,
          class and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdepended systems of discrimination or disadvatange."
          In simple terms, intersectionality shows that people can face multiple forms of privilege or oppression at the same time because of larger systems of
          power like racism, sexism or homophobia.
